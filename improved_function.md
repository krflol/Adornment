Original function `sample_function`:
@llm_improve()
def sample_function(x, y):
    #calculate celsius to fahrenheit
    celsius = (x + y) / 2
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit


LLM Improvement Suggestions:
Here are some improvements with type hinting applied, assuming `x` and `y` are intended to be numbers (float or int), and a decorator shouldn't be there unless specifically required:

1. Remove the `@llm_improve()` decorator if it's not defined or necessary.
2. Add a docstring to explain what the function does.
3. Add type hints for the parameters and the return type.
4. Use descriptive variable names.
5. Separate the calculation into smaller parts for clarity if needed.

Here's the improved version:

```python
def calculate_average_fahrenheit(temperature1: float, temperature2: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Fahrenheit equivalent of the average temperature given two Celsius values.
    
    Parameters:
    - temperature1 (float): The first Celsius temperature.
    - temperature2 (float): The second Celsius temperature.
    
    Returns:
    - float: The average temperature in Fahrenheit.
    """
    average_celsius = (temperature1 + temperature2) / 2
    fahrenheit = (average_celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit
```

In this revised function:

- Removed the unexplained `@llm_improve()` decorator.
- Added type hints (`float` for both input parameters and return type) assuming inputs are decimal numbers. If temperatures are more likely to be integers, you could use `int` instead.
- The function name `calculate_average_fahrenheit` explains what the function does more clearly than `sample_function`.
- Parameters are renamed from `x`, `y` to `temperature1`, `temperature2` for better clarity.
- Included a docstring explaining what the function does, including its parameters and return type.
- Kept the two-step calculation as it enhances readability, showing the clear step of converting to the average Celsius value and then converting that to Fahrenheit. You could combine them, but the minimal efficiency gain is not worth the loss in readability for most applications.
